# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project
The Car Dealership Management System is a console-based Java application designed 
to simulate a real-world dealership inventory system. It allows users (such as salespeople or managers) to view, add, and remove vehicles from an inventory that is persisted in a CSV file.

- I want to search vehicles by make, model, year, or price range
- I want to list all available vehicles
- I want to add new vehicles when new stock arrives
- I want to remove sold or outdated vehicles
